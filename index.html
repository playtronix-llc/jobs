      <h2>Overview</h2>

      <p>
        At Playtronix, We build AI-powered products for the next-gen of iGaming businesses.
        Think of it like AWS of iGaming, our backend is built with Go/PG/kubernets, modern tech stack
        in microservice based distributed system architecture, designed to absorb large transactions and 
        built as a next gen fintech platform.
      </p>
        
      <p>
        We evaluate candidates on broad distributed engineering skills
        and strong software engineering fundamentals; this guide applies to both frontend
        and backend interviews. Our interview framework focuses on problem-solving and
        learning agility, letting us see both depth and breadth. We want to understand not
        only how you code, but how you think. 
      </p>

      <h2>Timeline</h2>

      We are very decisive, we encourage you to discuss with your tech recruiter and book all the rounds within a week, our record time to give 
      offer is 3 working days. We have 2 rounds as follows,

      <h3>Stage 1 · Live coding round · 60 minutes · Online</h3>

      <i>NOTE: You will not be asked anything beyond easy / medium problems.</i>

      <p>
        In this interview, you will solve coding problems live using LeetCode’s online coding
        platform. You will share your screen with the interviewer throughout the session—no IDE
        setup is required.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please ensure you have an active LeetCode account before the interview, as all coding
        will be done directly on LeetCode during the session. 
      </p>
      <p>Each interview is capped at 60 minutes and is designed to evaluate:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Problem-solving skills</li>
        <li>Code quality and efficiency</li>
        <li>Understanding of algorithms and data structures</li>
        <li>Communication of thought process</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Stage 2 · Tech round · 60 minutes · On-site interview</h3>
      <p>
        <i>Note: This round is typically conducted offline at our Belgrade office. For candidates who apply on roles that is fully REMOTE, 
          interview is via Google Meet and <a href="https://excalidraw.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">excalidraw.com</a>
        for drawing system architecture.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
        This interview assesses your technical depth, breadth, and problem-solving through
        designing a solution to a defined problem. Your interviewer will evaluate your thought
        process, decision-making, and considerations such as performance and reliability. It
        varies between frontend and backend as follows:
      </p>

      <h4>Backend</h4>

      <p>
        It is a typical system design round. You will design a solution on a whiteboard or paper,
        starting with fundamentals and adding complexity. Asking clarifying questions early and
        clearly communicating your thinking is essential. We are interested in your approach, how
        you draw from past experience, and how you design with customers, scalability, and
        reliability in mind. You can also expect questions in the language of your specialty and
        some questions based on your previous experience.
      </p>

      <h4>Frontend</h4>

      <p>
        This round will be mix of theory and live-coding questions related to Frontend. 
        Theory questions may include across JS/TS, React and its ecosystem, system design and architecture, and frontend performance. 
        We will focus on language fundamentals and React internals. Expect scenario-based reasoning rather than rote
        definitions.
      </p>

      <p>
        In the live-coding segment, we will give tasks that are short and focused on
        practical skills e.g., code small utilities in JS/TS, solve a React component logic
        challenge, build a tiny state machine, or optimize a performance bottleneck. We evaluate
        code clarity, ability to reason about edge cases, and how well you translate theoretical
        knowledge into practice.
